Local browser-based document editor for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files. Runs the [ONLYOFFICE](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs) JavaScript SDK in a browser with a Node.js server handling format conversion.

Used as a downloadable extension in the Interpreter Workstation app.

## Document Flow

```
Open file
  → /open?filepath=/path/to/file.xlsx
  → x2t converts to ONLYOFFICE binary format
  → SDK renders document in browser (cell/word/slide editor)

Save file
  → SDK posts binary to /api/save
  → x2t converts back to XLSX/DOCX/PPTX
  → Written to original file path
```
